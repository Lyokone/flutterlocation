# location_web

The web implementation of [`location`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package is the endorsed implementation of `location` for the web platform since version `3.0.0`, so it gets automatically added to your dependencies by depending on `location: ^7.0.0`.

No modifications to your `pubspec.yaml` should be required in a recent enough version of Flutter (`>=1.12.13+hotfix.4`):

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  location: ^7.0.0
  ...
```

Once you have `location` in `pubspec.yaml` you should be able to use `package:location` as normal.

[1]: ../location
