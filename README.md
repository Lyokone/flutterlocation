This plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io)
handles getting location on Android and iOS. It also provides callbacks when location is changed.

# Breaking Changes
As of the 2.0 version, you have to call the returned location is an LocationData Object. You can just access the different attribute like so : location.latitude.
See the API part of the README for the changes.
This version also switched to AndroidX instead of the old Android Support library. In order to use it you have to do the following things:

Update your gradle.properties file with this:
```
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
```

Please also make sure that you have those dependencies in your build.gradle:
```
  dependencies {
      classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'
      classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.2.0'
  }
...
  compileSdkVersion 28
```


## Getting Started

In order to use this plugin in Android, you have to add this permission in AndroidManifest.xml :
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```
Permission check for Android 6+ was added. Still no callback when permissions granted
so aiming SDK 21 is safer.

And to use it in iOS, you have to add this permission in Info.plist :
```xml
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription
```

Then you just have to import the package with
```dart
import 'package:location/location.dart';
```

Look into the example for utilisation, but a basic implementation can be done like this for a one time location :
```dart
var currentLocation = <String, double>{};

var location = new Location();

// Platform messages may fail, so we use a try/catch PlatformException.
try {
  currentLocation = await location.getLocation;
} on PlatformException {
  currentLocation = null;
}
```

You can also get continuous callbacks when your position is changing:
```dart
var location = new Location();

location.onLocationChanged().listen((Map<String,double> currentLocation) {
  print(currentLocation["latitude"]);
  print(currentLocation["longitude"]);
  print(currentLocation["accuracy"]);
  print(currentLocation["altitude"]);
  print(currentLocation["speed"]);
  print(currentLocation["speed_accuracy"]); // Will always be 0 on iOS

});
```
