# Install on iOS

## Minimum deployment target

In order to use the `location` plugin, you need to set your minimum deployment
target to iOS 13.0 or later:

```ruby name="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

## Info.plist

In order to request location permissions, you need to add the following to your
`ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant location
permissions.

## Background location

If you want to receive background location, you need to add the following to
your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant background
location permissions.

You also need to activate enable background mode for the **Runner** target. Open
Xcode and go to "Signing & Capabilities". Add the "Background Modes" section and
add "Location updates" to the list.
