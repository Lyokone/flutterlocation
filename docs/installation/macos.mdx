# Install on macOS

## Minimum deployment target

In order to use Location, you need to set your minimum deployment target to macOS 11.0 or later.
Change the first line in your `macos/Podfile` into:

```
platform :osx, '11.0'
```

## Info.plist

In order to request location permissions, you need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant location permissions.

## Sandboxed application

Ensure that the application is properly "sandboxed" and that the location is enabled. You can do this in Xcode with the following steps:

1. In the project navigator, click on your application's target. This should bring up a view with tabs such as "General", "Capabilities", "Resource Tags", etc.
2. Click on the "Signing and Capabilities" tab. This will give you a list of items such as "App Groups", "App Sandbox", and so on. Each item will have an "On/Off" button.
3. Turn on the "App Sandbox" item and press the ">" button on the left to show the sandbox informations.
4. In the "App Data" section, select "Location".

## About macOS

The location is not precise while using macOS since the computers don't have a GPS.
Some settings will have no effect in order to keep the location as precise as possible.
