# Settings

With Location, there is two ways to change your location settings.

## Individual Requests

You change settings for an individual getLocation request like described in the [`getLocation`](/features/get-location) section.

## Global Settings

```dart
Future<void> setLocationSettings({
  /// If set to true, the user will be prompted to grant permission to use location
  /// if not already granted.
  bool askForPermission = true,

  /// The message to display to the user when asking for permission to use location.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  /// For iOS, you have to change the permission in the Info.plist file.
  String rationaleMessageForPermissionRequest =
      'The app needs to access your location',

  /// The message to display to the user when asking for permission to use GPS.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  String rationaleMessageForGPSRequest =
      'The app needs to access your location',

  /// If set to true, the app will use Google Play Services to request location.
  /// If not available on the device, the app will fallback to GPS.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  bool useGooglePlayServices = true,

  /// If set to true, the app will request Google Play Services to request location.
  /// If not available on the device, the app will fallback to GPS.
  bool askForGooglePlayServices = false,

  /// If set to true, the app will request GPS to request location.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  bool askForGPS = true,

  /// If set to true, the app will fallback to GPS if Google Play Services is not
  /// available on the device.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  bool fallbackToGPS = true,

  /// If set to true, the app will ignore the last known position
  /// and request a fresh one
  bool ignoreLastKnownPosition = true,

  /// The duration of the location request.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  double? expirationDuration,

  /// The expiration time of the location request.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  double? expirationTime,

  /// The fastest interval between location updates.
  /// In milliseconds.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  double fastestInterval = 500,

  /// The interval between location updates.
  /// In milliseconds.
  double interval = 1000,

  /// The maximum amount of time the app will wait for a location.
  /// In milliseconds.
  double? maxWaitTime,

  /// The number of location updates to request.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  int? numUpdates,

  /// The accuracy of the location request.
  LocationAccuracy accuracy = LocationAccuracy.high,

  /// The smallest displacement between location updates.
  double smallestDisplacement = 0,

  /// If set to true, the app will wait for an accurate location.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  bool waitForAccurateLocation = true,

  /// The accptable accuracy of the location request.
  /// Only valid on Android.
  double? acceptableAccuracy,
})
```

When you call `setLocationSettings`, the current `onLocationChanged` will be updated with the new settings without being closed.

The next `getLocation` call will also use the new settings.
