# Get Location

To get the location of the user, you can simply use

```dart
Future<LocationData> getLocation({LocationSettings? settings})
```

To see all the settings, see [the settings](/features/settings) page.

By default, the call will try to **request permission** if needed, **activate GPS** and return the location without anything needed from your part.
If something goes wrong the call will throw.

If you have set global settings, it will use those settings instead of the default ones.

If you are currently listening for location with `onLocationChanged`, it will use the settings from this call.

If you call getLocation multiples times, the requests will be queued and they will receive the same location when available.

## Examples

### Getting location

```dart
final location = await getLocation();
print("Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
```

### With custom settings

```dart
final location = await getLocation(
    settings: LocationSettings(ignoreLastKnownPosition: true),
);
print("Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
```
