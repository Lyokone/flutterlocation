# Services

Services refers to the options available to you in order to get the location of your user.

On **Android** you can have the status of the GPS and Network services.
The Network service is often less precise.

On **iOS** both the GPS and the Network service are available but cannot be requested individually. Either the Location Service is activated or not.

```dart
Future<bool> isGPSEnabled()
```

```dart
Future<bool> isNetworkEnabled()
```

If the service are disabled, you can make a call to `getLocation` or `onLocationChanged`.
The call will automatically try to activate the required location service depending on the precision request for the location.
