# Notification

When you listen for background location, a notification is displayed on Android. This methods allows you to update the notification.

```dart
Future<bool> changeNotificationOptions({
  String? channelName,
  String? title,
  String? iconName,
  String? subtitle,
  String? description,
  Color? color,
  bool? onTapBringToFront,
})
```

`iconName` is the name of the icon to display.
It should be in the `res/drawable` folder with the same name. By default, the library gives you a transparent icon.

## Examples

### Updating the notification with the current location

The notification will only appear on Android

```dart
final location = Location();
location.enableBackgroundMode(enable: true);
_locationSubscription = location.onLocationChanged
    .listen((LocationData currentLocation) async {
        await location.changeBackgroundOptions(
            subtitle:
                'Location: ${currentLocation.latitude}, ${currentLocation.longitude}',
            onTapBringToFront: true,
        );
    }
);

...

_locationSubscription?.cancel();
```
