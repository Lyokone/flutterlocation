# Testing

If you want to set a custom Location for testing you can use the `Location.instance` property.
Here is an example with Mocktail

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:location/location.dart';
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart';

class MockLocation extends Mock implements Location {}

void main() {
  testWidgets('get location ...', (tester) async {
    final mock = MockLocation();

    when(mock.getLocation).thenAnswer(
      (invocation) async => LocationData.fromMap({'latitude': 42, 'longitude': 2}),
    );

    Location.instance = mock;
  });
}
```
